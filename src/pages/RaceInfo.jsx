          All divisions of the race will be held on a 7.2 mile clockwise loop.
          <span className="font-bold">Single Spicy Lap</span> entrants will complete a single lap of the course, the
          <span className="font-bold">Moreathon</span> and relay team entrants will complete 4 laps of the course,
          totaling 28.8 miles, and <span className="font-bold">Maximum Reaper</span> entrants will complete 5 laps, 
          totalling 36 miles. The loop is hilly, but each downhill rolls out.
          Skaters must be comfortable controlling their speed downhill, and
          completing a right-hand turn on a downhill slope.
        </P>
        <P>
          The loop has one right-hand turn close to the start/finish line which
          will be monitored by a course marshal. The loop is an open, low
          traffic, road course. Skaters must observe the "yellow line rule", that
          is, they must not cross the yellow line during the event.
        </P>
        <P>
          In approximately the last 200 meters leading up to the start/finish
          line the road splits into 2 lanes. This section of the course is our
          designated relay zone, and will be marked with yellow tape on the
          road. Solo Moreathon skaters will need to be aware of relay hand offs
          in this section, and stay to the left to keep their pace. Merge to
          the right as soon as it is safe so your timing chip can be easily
          read when crossing the start/finish line.
