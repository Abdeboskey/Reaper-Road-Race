          All divisions of the race will be held on a 7.2 mile clockwise loop.
          11.5K entrants will complete a single lap of the course, and the
          Moreathon and relay team entrants will complete 4 laps of the course,
          totaling 28.8 miles. The loop is hilly, but each downhill rolls out.
          Skaters must be comfortable controlling their speed downhill, and
          completing a right-hand turn on a downhill slope.
        </P>
        <P>
          The loop has one right-hand turn close to the start/finish line which
          will be monitored by a course marshal. The loop is an open, low
          traffic, road course. Skaters must observe the "yellow line rule", that
          is, they must not cross the yellow line during the event.
        </P>
        <P>
          In approximately the last 200 meters leading up to the start/finish
          line the road splits into 2 lanes. This section of the course is our
          designated relay zone. The left lane will be used by all solo skaters, to
          provide room for the relay skaters to safely make baton hand offs in the
          main traveling lane. Solo skaters will merge back in to the main
          traveling lane before crossing the start/finish line.
